# NYC Mobility Trends Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the rush-hour and mobility patterns in New York City, utilizing statistical analysis and heatmap visualizations to gain insights into urban transportation dynamics. The findings aim to inform strategic planning for improved traffic management and ride-sharing operational efficiency.

## Features
- Heatmap visualizations of activity by hour and day.
- Statistical analysis of peak rush hours and low-activity periods.
- Temporal trends across different times of the month and weekends.
- Recommendations for resource allocation and policy planning.

## Data
The data used in this project includes timestamps and geolocation information of active vehicles in NYC, anonymized and aggregated to protect privacy.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data processing and analysis.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium for visualization.
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development.

## Findings
Key insights include the identification of a peak activity window around 6 PM, progressive activity increase from noon to evening, and variations in activity levels throughout the month and on weekends.

## Usage
The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that detail the data analysis process, which can be run to reproduce the findings or to apply the methodology to similar datasets.
